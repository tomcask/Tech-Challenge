# Tech Challenge

## Task definition

We would like you to build a web app that displays the trending GIFs on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/).
Users visiting the website should be able to search for GIFs and see a list of results. The user should be able to expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, anything you think could be relevant).

Users should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

- Technologies to be used: **ES6**, **TDD**, **React.js** and **SCSS** or **LESS**.
- We follow the TDD philosophy, create a test red, making pass GREEN, refactor and commit.

## What's to deliver

- Link to the source code, use your favorite repository manager (GitHub, GitLab, ...)
- Link to the deployed Demo, use your favorite static site hosting platform (surge, github-pages, now, ...)

- The app should run on any computer by running `npm install` , `npm test` and have a demo online.

- We'll evaluate the exercise by looking commits and test passed.

## Improvements

We strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. The following are just some ideas, so if none of these interest you, feel free to do something that isn’t on this list:

- When the user scrolls the page to the bottom, load new GIFs automatically.
- Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder when GIFs are still loading.
- Show off your animation skills!
- Sort the results by uploaded time and let the user choose if they prefer ascending or descending ordering.
- Let the user favorite GIFs and list their favorites. The users should be able to retrieve their favorite GIFs even after refreshing the page.
- Provide the ultimate user experience: scrolling, searching, fetching… could be optimized for UX.
- Let the user upload a GIF.
- Add some unit tests.

## Project Structure

You can use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), feel free to use this structure if you'd like. If you'd prefer to use something other than React or you'd prefer a different project structure, go ahead and make any changes you'd like.

## Notes

Please, don't open a PR against this repo. Just follow the direction from the recruiter on how to submit the exercise.

For us it is very important to follow the TDD philosophy.
